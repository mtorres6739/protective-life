## Protective® Classic Choice term

Consider this solution for clients who want streamlined, inexpensive protection for a specific period of time with an easy-to-understand policy. Coverage is available for 10-, 15-, 20-, 25-, 30-, 35- and 40-year periods.

The death benefit is guaranteed for the term period a client selects and the premium will remain the same throughout their selected term period. If a client decides to keep their policy after the initial term period ends, the policy premiums will increase annually but the death benefit amount will remain guaranteed.
