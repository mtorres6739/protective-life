## Simplified issue process

If your client meets age and premium requirements and can answer "no" to a short series of medical questions, they may qualify for 10-minute instant approval. Eligibility is subject to meeting Protective's qualification requirements. Additional underwriting is required if the application does not qualify for a 10-minute approval decision.

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Stage 1 | Complete only the simplified issue section of the application via EZ-App℠ authorization to obtain Information form must be signed by insured(s) prior to submission. |
| Stage 2 | Upon submission, the application will be evaluated by an automated underwriting service. Within 5 minutes, a message on the agent statement screen in EZ-App will indicate whether the client is instantly approved or if further underwriting is required. |
| Stage 3 | If instantly approved, complete the Life Post Blind SOP. Insurance coverage will begin as soon as payment is collected. If not instantly approved, Protective will further review the application. The policy will still be underwritten with the simplified issue rating classes and issue age limitations. |
