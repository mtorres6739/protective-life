# Protection for your loved ones

Life insurance is about protection. It helps provide security for your loved ones when they need it most. It can help ensure they don't face the added burden of financial pressures should something happen to you.

## Death benefit coverage

The death benefit from your policy can be paid directly to your beneficiaries to help them replace your income and maintain their standard of living. It may also help cover things like burial and final expenses and recurring or future expenses.

You also have the option of decreasing your death benefit amount without having to buy a new, separate policy if your needs change.

Your death benefit coverage can even be guaranteed for your lifetime, meaning your policy will not lapse as long as your planned premiums are paid.¹

## Making your policy

In addition to providing death benefit coverage, Protective Advantage Choice UL also offers potential cash value accumulation and can be there when you need it for future expenses or unexpected costs.

## Cash value accumulation and access

With Protective Advantage Choice UL, a portion of each premium payment goes into the "policy value" which is the part of the policy that earns interest. Your policy's cash value accumulates on a tax-deferred basis,² which means you may not be taxed until you withdraw funds — allowing it to grow unhindered. The current interest rate credited to your policy value may change at any time. While the overall economic environment influences interest rates, they are not indexed to any national standard and are subject to change at the discretion of Protective. The current interest rate will never be less than the guaranteed rate of 2.0%.

Although a life insurance policy is intended to help meet long-term needs, we understand that you may need or want to access your policy value. With Protective Advantage Choice UL, you have access to your policy value any time after the first policy year through withdrawals or loans.

Maybe you're planning on tapping into your policy's cash value to help with things like college tuition, home renovations or supplemental retirement income. Maybe you just need help managing the unexpected costs that arise in life. No matter what your situation is, Protective Advantage Choice UL can help.

¹ Lapse protection guarantees the policy death benefit for the duration of the guarantee and does not cover cash or surrender value. Loans, withdrawals, and other policy and premium changes will affect the cost and length of protection. Failure to make premium payment as planned may cause the policy to lose lapse protection and premiums required to restore it could be significantly higher. Refer to the policy and endorsements for complete terms, conditions and limitations.

² The tax treatment of life insurance is subject to change. Neither Protective Life Insurance Company nor its representatives offer legal or tax advice. Please consult with your legal or tax advisor regarding your individual situation before making any tax-related decisions.

Protective Advantage Choice UL | Flexibility

## Premium flexibility

We all have different financial needs, responsibilities and limitations. And because our lives are always changing, flexibility is a must-have.

With Protective Advantage Choice UL, you can choose to pay a level premium for your lifetime, for a certain period of time, or you can adjust premiums to correspond with your expected income level.

And if you ever have to miss a premium, all your guaranteed coverage won't disappear. We've designed Protective Advantage Choice UL to withstand the test of life — especially when the unforeseen happens.

## The strength of Protective Advantage Choice UL

Consider this example where a policyholder misses two premiums.

| Age | 60 | 71 | 81 | 96 | 105 |
|-----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| Event | Buys policy guaranteed to age 105. | Misses premium payment. | Misses premium payment. | New guarantee age, after skipping two premiums. | Original guarantee age, if all premiums paid. |

Assumes Male, Age 60, Standard Non-Tobacco, $500,000 Death Benefit, Guarantee to Age 105, Skipped Premiums in Years 11 and 21

As you can see in this example, a policyholder only loses nine years off their guarantee and, at age 96, that's still protection beyond life expectancy!

Guarantee age refers to the attained age of the insured to which benefits are guaranteed. After this point, coverage may depend on the policy's surrender value.

## Living benefits

The Protective Advantage Choice UL policy earns a guaranteed annual effective interest rate of 2.0%. The current credited rate could be higher and will be determined periodically by Protective Life.

If you need to access your policy's cash value, all withdrawals are charged a $25 fee and may reduce your policy's death benefit amount, subject to minimums. Withdrawals will also impact lapse protection and surrender charges may apply. Loans are available after the first policy year and interest will be charged at 5% in arrears for all policy years. Keep in mind loans and withdrawals may impact the policy. If you decide to fully surrender your policy during the first nine years, there will be a charge that varies by age, gender and underwriting class.
