Protective® Indexed Choice℠ UL

While using ExtendCare benefits, you won't be required to pay premiums or policy expenses, and after three years of chronic illness, all premiums and expenses are permanently waived.

That means for the same premium, you can add a key rider to your life insurance policy to help relieve some of the financial burden if you were to develop a chronic illness, and still be covered beyond life expectancy.

Let's talk about how Protective Indexed Choice UL with ExtendCare may be the right fit for you.

Protective refers to Protective Life Insurance Company (PLICO) located in Nashville, TN, and its affiliates, including Protective Life and Annuity Insurance Company (PLAIC) located in Birmingham, AL.

This illustration assumes that the currently illustrated non-guaranteed elements will continue unchanged for all years shown. This is not likely to occur, and actual results may be more or less favorable than those shown. As a result, additional premium outlays may be required to keep the policy in force or to achieve desired results.

Protective Indexed Choice UL (UL-27) is a flexible premium universal life insurance policy issued by PLICO and PLAIC. Policy form numbers, product features and availability may vary by state. Consult policies for benefits, riders, limitations and exclusions. Subject to underwriting. Up to a two-year contestable and suicide period. Benefits adjusted for misstatements of age or sex.

Protective Indexed Choice UL is not a security investment and is not an investment in the market. Clients should be provided with costs and complete details about the terms, conditions, limitations or exclusions that apply to this policy.

The tax treatment of life insurance is subject to change. Neither Protective nor its representatives offer legal or tax advice. Consumers should consult with their legal or tax advisor regarding their individual situation before making any tax-related decisions. All payments and all guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of PLICO.

ExtendCare falls under IRC Sec. 101(g) Accelerated Death Benefit guidelines and does not fall under health regulations. This differentiation could affect eligibility for public assistance programs such as Medicaid, Supplemental Income or others. Purchasers should consult a qualified advisor along with legal or tax advisor to determine if the rider will affect their initial or continued eligibility for public assistance programs or other tax-related decisions.

ExtendCare (ICC16-L638/L638 12-16) is issued by PLICO and PLAIC. Subject to underwriting and up to a two-year contestable and suicide period. Benefits adjusted for misstatements of age or sex.
