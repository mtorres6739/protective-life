# Built in flexibility for the unexpected

Sometimes the unexpected happens and you need access to additional cash. That's why we've built Protective Advantage Choice℠ UL with a no-cost return of premium (ROP) endorsement. Our straightforward ROP endorsement gives policyholders the flexibility to access all, or part, of their premiums.¹

| Contract anniversary | Premiums returned |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| 20th year            | 50%               |
| 25th year            | 100%              |

## Here's how it works:

Eric, a 35-year-old male, purchases a Protective Advantage Choice UL policy with a $250,001 death benefit. His premium is $116.05 per month. After 25 years, he can get 100% of his premium payments back: $34,815.

Think of what else he can accomplish with this lump sum—like a down payment on a home or covering an unexpected medical bill.

# Flexible design backed by the strength of our promise

With Protective Advantage Choice UL's ROP endorsement, you're gaining the flexibility to access the premiums you've paid at no added cost. Here are some key factors in why our endorsement is different from our competitors.

| Flexibility | No-added cost |
|-------------|---------------|
| Many competitors limit the return window to later in the policy or limit the amount of returned premium you can get. With our endorsement, you have options and can get up to 100% of your investment back. | Many competitors charge a fee for their return of premium endorsements. We believe this benefit should be built in to every policy at no added cost. |
