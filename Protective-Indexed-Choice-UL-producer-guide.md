## Interest accounts

| | |
|---|---|
| | Fixed account, indexed account or both. |
| | All premiums received after policy issue will initially be allocated to the fixed account where they earn interest until the 15th of the month. At that time, the premium amount will be allocated to the Indexed Account according to the selected allocation percentage. |
| Interest accounts and premium payments | The fixed account interest rate is guaranteed never to be below 1%. The current credited rate could be higher and is subject to change at the discretion of Protective. |
| | The indexed account earns interest based on a guaranteed 100% participation rate in the S&P 500 Index (excluding dividends). It has a guaranteed cap rate of 3% and a floor rate of 0%. The current cap rate could be higher and is subject to change at the discretion of Protective. See The indexed account section for more detailed information. |
| Indexed segments | When a premium payment is allocated to the indexed account, an indexed segment is created. Indexed segments are created on the 15th of each month, and there may be 12 different segments in different stages of maturity at any given time. |
| Indexed crediting strategy | Annual point-to-point; each indexed segment will accrue interest based on the percentage change in the S&P 500 (excluding dividends) value on the 15th of the prior year to the index value on the 14th of the current year. Interest is applied to each segment at the segment's indexed crediting date which occurs one year after the allocation date. |
| Credited interest rate calculation | The interest rate credited to an indexed segment is subject to interest cap and floor rates and equals: 100% Participation Rate x ((S&P 500 Value End of Segment Year) — (S&P 500 Value Beginning of Segment Year)) / (S&P 500 Value Beginning of Segment Year)) |
| Participation rate | A 100% participation rate is guaranteed, subject to the policy's cap rate. The participation rate determines what percentage of the S&P 500's increase applies to your client's policy as interest. |
| Cap rate | The minimum guaranteed cap rate is 3%. The policy cap rate is the maximum interest rate that can be credited to a segment. The indexed account value is credited with an interest rate equal to any percentage increase in the S&P 500 (excluding dividends) during the indexed segment year, up to the specified current cap rate. |
| Floor rate | The guaranteed floor rate is 0%. Your client's policy will never lose value due to negative S&P 500 performance during that year. Policy charges and fees will continue to be withdrawn from the policy value. |
| Total indexed account value | The total indexed account value is the sum of all indexed segments. |

# Access to policy value

| Loan details | The loaned value receives the same indexed crediting rate as the unloaned policy value. |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Loan interest | Guaranteed maximum of 8% in arrears for all policy years. The current rate is subject to change at the discretion of Protective Life. |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Surrender charges

- Full surrender is available at any time.
- There is a declining surrender charge in the first 19 years of the policy.
- On a face decrease resulting from an elected decrease or the result of a partial surrender, a partial surrender charge will be deducted from the policy value. It is calculated as follows:
  1. Calculate the total full-surrender charge (net of any prior partial surrender charges).
  2. Divide the face amount reduction by the total policy face amount prior to decrease.
  3. The partial surrender charge is equal to the result of step two times the result of step one.
- After a face decrease, future surrender charges will be reduced proportionately by the amount of surrender charges already deducted.

Any surrender less than full surrender is considered a withdrawal or partial surrender.

## Withdrawals/ partial surrenders

- Partial surrenders are available after the first Policy Year.
- May reduce the face amount and affect policy accumulation
- Cannot reduce the face amount below minimum face amount
- May have a negative impact on the duration of the lapse protection
- Taxation may occur upon lapse or surrender
- A $25 fee will be charged for each partial surrender

## Optional endorsements and riders

| Endorsement/Rider | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Accidental death benefit rider | Can provide coverage that pays an additional death benefit if the insured dies as the result of an accident. |
| Children's term life insurance rider | Rather than purchasing individual policies on their children, the policy owner can use this rider to provide death benefit protection for all natural, adopted and stepchildren within issue age limits. |
| ExtendCare℠ rider | Advances a portion of the base policy's death benefit if the insured is certified by a licensed health care practitioner within the past 12 months as chronically ill. Please note the ExtendCare rider is not available in California or New York. |
| Income provider option | Optional endorsement which allows the policy owner to select a guaranteed monthly or annual income stream for the death benefit payout. |
| Terminal illness/ accelerated death benefit | Included at no extra charge, this benefit can accelerate up to 60% of the policy's death benefit, or $1 million total, whichever is less. Please note that the terminal illness/accelerated death benefit is not available in New York. |
| Waiver of specified premium rider | Specified premiums are waived if you become disabled, with a six-month elimination period before the waiver benefit takes effect. |

## Lapse protection

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Lapse protection endorsement | Lapse protection guarantees the policy death benefit for the duration of the guarantee and does not cover cash or surrender value. Loans, withdrawals and other policy and premium changes will affect the cost and length of protection. Failure to make premium payments as planned may cause the policy to lose lapse protection and premiums required to restore it could be significantly higher. Refer to the policy and endorsements for complete terms, conditions and limitations. |
| Catch-up | If lapse protection is lost, your clients may restore it by paying additional or higher premiums. The premiums required to restore lapse protection may be significantly higher than the premiums illustrated. |

## Policy lapses

### Grace period

If on any monthly anniversary, the cash value minus the policy debt is insufficient to pay the monthly deduction for the upcoming month and the lapse protection is not in effect, the policy will enter the grace period. The policy owner has 61 days to cover the current and past due monthly deductions. The policy will remain in force during the grace period, but if the premium payment is not received by the end of the grace period, the policy will lapse. Premiums received 31 days or more past the due date will also incur an interest rate penalty.

## Policy changes

### Increase coverage

The minimum face amount increase allowed is $25,000 and proof of insurability will be required.

### Decrease coverage

After the policy has been in force for at least three years, a decrease may be requested. The new face amount may not be less than the minimum face amount. A withdrawal/partial surrender charge will be deducted with any face amount decrease.
