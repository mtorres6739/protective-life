# Lapse protection

## Lapse protection endorsement

Lapse protection guarantees the policy death benefit for the duration of the guarantee and does not cover cash or surrender value. Loans, withdrawals, and other policy and premium changes will affect the cost and length of protection. Failure to make premium payments as planned may cause the policy to lose lapse protection and premiums required to restore it could be significantly higher. Refer to the policy and endorsements for complete terms, conditions, and limitations.

## Catch up

If lapse protection is lost, your clients may restore it by paying additional or higher premiums. The premiums required to restore lapse protection may be significantly higher than the premiums illustrated.

# Policy lapses

## Grace period

If on any monthly anniversary, the cash value minus the policy debt is insufficient to pay the monthly deduction for the upcoming month and the lapse protection is not in effect, the policy will enter the grace period. The policy will lapse.

# Policy changes

## Decrease coverage

After the policy has been in force for at least three years, a decrease may be requested. The new face amount may not be less than the minimum face amount. A withdrawal/partial surrender charge will be deducted with any face amount decrease.

# Policy owner information

## Annual report

A personalized report is sent after each policy anniversary. The report shows the status of the Lapse Protection Account, premium payments, interest credits, cost of insurance charges, expense charges, loans, partial surrenders, surrender value and policy value.

## The policy

The policy form, including all endorsements, will provide information regarding benefits provided, premium payments, charges, determination of values, the Lapse Protection Endorsement, and other provisions and charges.

# Access to policy value

| Loan details | Loans are available after year one. Interest on all policy loans will be compounded. Loans and withdrawals may negatively impact policy performance, the death benefit and lapse protection. |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Loan interest | 5% in arrears for all policy years. |
| Loan credited rate | The portion of the policy value equal to policy debt will earn interest at a guaranteed rate of 2.0%. |

## Surrender charges

- Full surrender is available at any time.
- There is a declining surrender charge in the first nine years of the policy.
- On a face decrease resulting from an elected decrease or the result of a partial surrender, a partial surrender charge will be deducted from the policy value. It is calculated as follows:
  1. Calculate the total full-surrender charge (net of any prior partial surrender charges).
  2. Divide the face amount reduction amount by the total policy face amount prior to decrease.
  3. The partial surrender charge is equal to the result of step two multiplied by the result of step one.
- After a face decrease, future surrender charges will be reduced proportionately by the amount of surrender charges already deducted.

## Partial surrender/ withdrawals

Any surrender less than full surrender is considered a partial surrender.

- Partial surrenders are available after the first Policy Year.
- May reduce the face amount and affect policy accumulation.
- Cannot reduce the face amount below minimum face amount.
- Will have a negative impact on the duration of the lapse protection.
- Taxation may occur upon lapse or surrender.
- A $25 fee will be charged for each partial surrender.
