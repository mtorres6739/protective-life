Protective Indexed Choice℠ Universal Life

# Indexed Universal Life 101

Indexed Universal Life (IUL) can provide lifelong protection with a death benefit that will be paid out to beneficiaries should something happen to you. In addition, your policy can grow cash value by earning interest based on positive changes in one or more market indexes.

## How it works:

| You make a premium payment. A premium load charge is deducted. | With each premium payment, your cash value grows. | You can access your cash value through withdrawals and loans.¹ This could be used for unexpected expenses or as an emergency financial resource. | The policy's death benefit is paid to your beneficiaries tax-free. |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|

| Minus policy charges and expenses to pay for the policy death benefit. | Cash value grows based on the allocation made to the indexed and fixed accounts. | Each allocation to the indexed account measures the growth of the market index for a certain period of time — this is known as the indexed segment and is subject to a maximum cap rate. The fixed account earns interest at guaranteed company-declared rate.² |

## What happens if the market index drops?

Your cash value is protected because you will get a guaranteed minimum interest rate (known as the floor rate).³

## How does Protective keep IUL simple?

Protective Indexed Choice UL allows you to earn interest on positive growth in the S&P 500 with a maximum rate of 8.0%.⁴ You'll also be protected from loss, as your policy will never return an interest rate less than 0%. Because we apply a more practical rate and keep policy fees low, you could have the potential to grow more cash value.

Let's talk more to see if IUL is the right fit for your needs.

1 If a loan is taken out against the cash value, you must repay it or any outstanding loans will be deducted from the death benefit.

2 All payments and all guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of Protective Life Insurance Company.

3 It's important to keep in mind that policy charges and fees will continue to be withdrawn even if the floor rate occurs.

4 The cap rate is current as of November 2019 and is subject to change at the discretion of Protective Life.
