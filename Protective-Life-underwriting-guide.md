# Foreign travel & foreign national guidelines

## Foreign travel guidelines

The Swiss Re Life Guide will be our primary resource for underwriting risks related to foreign travel. These guidelines address the country(ies) being visited, as well as other risk factors such as the specific region with the country, purpose of the travel, occupation, frequency and total duration. After consideration of all risk factors, short duration travel may be eligible for more favorable rate classes. In addition to the information provided on the application, a foreign travel questionnaire may also be required.

Additional considerations include:

- Purpose for and specific location of the travel.
- Short term travel is defined as 8 weeks or less annually. Durations of up to 6 months annually will be considered as "travel" under these guidelines. For our purposes, travel durations of more than 6 months annually will be considered as foreign "residence."
- All benefits and riders will be individually underwritten.

## Foreign national guidelines

### Category 1
