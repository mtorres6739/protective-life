# Customize your coverage

Because every family and business situation can be unique, Protective has designed its policies to provide flexibility to its customers. Policy riders and endorsements allow you to customize your coverage even further to fit your specific needs.

These are intended to supplement your policy for very specific purposes. For example, a rider can provide a death benefit for your children, allow you to use a portion of the death benefit to manage the cost of a chronic illness, or provide benefits if you become disabled. You choose specific riders or endorsements to create the additional coverage you need and to fill any gaps in your long-term plans.

*Please note that riders and endorsements may not be available in all states, and state variations may apply.*

The image at the bottom of the document shows an outdoor scene with a child sitting on an adult's shoulders. They appear to be in a grassy area with trees in the background. The child is leaning down to look at the adult's face, and both seem to be smiling and enjoying the moment together. This image likely represents the concept of family protection that insurance products aim to provide.

# ExtendCareSM Rider (L652)

A portion of the base policy's death benefit is advanced if the insured is chronically ill, as certified within the last 12 months by a licensed health care practitioner. Chronic illness is defined as being unable to perform at least two activities of daily living without assistance for at least 90 days or requiring substantial supervision for protection from health and safety threats due to severe cognitive impairment.

Please note: This rider is intended to be received on a tax-favorable basis. The rider falls under IRC Sec. 101(g) Accelerated Death Benefit guidelines, not under health care regulations.

- Issue ages: 20-80 (subject to policy issue age limits)
- Maximum substandard rating: Table 4 and must meet all medical underwriting eligibility criteria
- Minimum face amount: $100,000
- Maximum face amount: $5 million
- Elimination period: 90 days
- Benefit period: 12 months
- Benefit payment type: Monthly or lump sum
- Lifetime maximum benefit: 100% of the available policy death benefit at time of claim
- The Maximum Monthly Benefit may not exceed the monthly equivalent of the per diem limitations declared by the Internal Revenue Service and may not exceed 5% of the base policy face amount
- At time of claim, a lesser monthly benefit amount of at least $250 may be requested if you do not require the entire maximum monthly benefit amount. The lifetime maximum benefit is only reduced by the amount of benefit actually taken each month. Monthly benefit options are subject to change
- Rider charge: Monthly charge varies by sex, issue age, underwriting class, face amount, waiting period length, monthly benefit and policy year
- Availability: Only at policy issue

| Available on: |
|---------------|
| - ProClassic IISM UL |
| - Protective Advantage ChoiceSM UL |
| - Protective Indexed ChoiceSM UL |

The policy's cost basis is reduced by the month-to-date rider cost deductions of ExtendCare.

ExtendCare Form (L652 7-20/ICC20-L652) is available only at issue and at an additional cost. Actual terms and conditions contained the rider govern all benefits provided. Please see rider for more detailed information. Assumes medical and financial underwriting qualification at time of initial application. ExtendCare falls under IRC Sec. 101(g), Accelerated Death Benefit guidelines and does not fall under health regulations. This differentiation could affect eligibility for public assistance programs such as Medicaid, Supplemental Income, or others. Purchasers should consult a qualified advisor along with legal or tax advisor to determine if the rider will affect their initial or continued eligibility for public assistance programs or other tax-related decisions.

The ExtendCare benefits are intended to be received on a tax-favored basis under section 101(g) of the Internal Revenue Code. Once eligible for the benefit, policyholders will receive a monthly payment (not exceeding 5% of the base policy's death benefit amount or the current per diem equivalent) accelerated from their policy's death benefit. The ExtendCare rider is intended as a nonmedical supplement. While long-term care riders pay temporary and permanent claims, policyholders with the ExtendCare rider will qualify for accelerated monthly benefits after being certified by a licensed healthcare practitioner as chronically ill for a period that is expected to last 90 days. Additionally, if the benefits for a stand-alone long-term care policy are not used, the policy may end with no payment while the face amount of a life insurance policy with an accelerated death benefit rider will remain intact if the benefits are not used. Once you qualify for the benefit, the payments will continue every month during the benefit period regardless of whether expenses are actually incurred.
