# Term life insurance: Protection that fits in your budget

Term life insurance is generally a budget-friendly option that's designed to provide death benefit protection for a set period of time.

## Term insurance is a good option if you:

| Have a limited budget | Have a family with young children | Want to supplement an existing life insurance policy | Have short-term financial needs |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------:|

## Life insurance might be more affordable than you think

One of the most common myths about life insurance is around the cost. 15% of consumers say they haven't bought life insurance because it's too expensive, and more than 65% overestimate its true cost.

For instance, a 30-year-old could buy a 35-year term policy for less than $25 a month. That's about 6 cups of gourmet coffee.¬π

| Statistic | Percentage |
|-----------|------------|
| Consumers who haven't bought life insurance due to perceived cost | 15% |
| Consumers who overestimate the true cost | 65% |

Protective¬Æ Classic Choice term | How it works

## Term coverage that's just right for your life

With Protective Classic Choice term, you can choose the amount of life insurance coverage you need for a set period, as short as 10 or as long as 40 years.

| 10 Years | 15 Years | 20 Years |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 25 Years | 30 Years | 35 Years | 40 Years |

## Guaranteed protection to cover everyday expenses and future goals

The death benefit on your policy will be guaranteed and you'll have the same recurring payment (known as a "premium") each year during your term period. If you decide to keep your policy after the term period ends, the policy premiums will increase annually but the death benefit amount will remain guaranteed.

The death benefit from your policy can help cover:

| Funeral expenses | Mortgage and car payments | College tuition |
|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Outstanding debts | Household expenses | Weddings |
