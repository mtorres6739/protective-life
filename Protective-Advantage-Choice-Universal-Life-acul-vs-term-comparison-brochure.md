# Weighing Temporary and Permanent Coverage

If you're trying to decide which products to quote, it first helps to understand the client's life insurance needs. Here are some common factors to discuss when determining whether temporary or permanent coverage might be the best fit:

| CLIENT 1 | CLIENT 2 |
|----------|----------|
| **TEMPORARY NEEDS** | **PERMANENT NEEDS** |
| • Paying off a major purchase like a home or car | • Covering final expenses (funeral costs, estate management, etc.) |
| • Covering expenses for childcare or child's education | • Creating an emergency fund |
| • Carrying significant credit card debt | • Ensuring a surviving spouse still has income |
| **Consider** | **Consider** |
| PROTECTIVE SERIES PASSPORT℠ TERM<br>or<br>PROTECTIVE ADVANTAGE CHOICE UL | PROTECTIVE ADVANTAGE CHOICE UL |

As you can guess, many clients could fall into both buckets. That's why it's important to present them with both options so they can choose. Furthermore, temporary needs can turn into permanent needs and Protective Advantage Choice UL can span both time periods.

## Delivering what's promised. 100 years and counting.

Simply put, we believe in doing the right thing in every action and decision, large and small. We're careful about the promises we make — and make sure we deliver on them. It's how we continue to build trust and relationships that last.
