# Simplifying the fully underwritten application process with TeleLife

At Protective, we strive to provide solutions that integrate into your core business, not distract from it. And a straightforward application process is a key consideration — for both you and your clients — when evaluating the right life insurance for their needs.

When you submit a fully underwritten Protective Series Passport℠ term or Protective Series Whole Life ticket, our TeleLife team eases the entire application process. In fact, TeleLife collects client information for you, allowing you to spend more time with your clients and building your business.

After submitting a life insurance application,* our TeleLife team receives the ticket immediately and takes care of the rest:

| Sales representative | Client | TeleLife team | TeleLife actions |
|----------------------|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Submits application | Completes a brief TeleLife phone interview | | Schedules exams |
| | | | Orders records |
| | | | Requests additional information |
| | | | Obtains signatures |

And since TeleLife agents are our employees, you can expect our standard of quality throughout the entire process.

By offering clients Protective Series Passport term and Protective Series Whole Life, both you and your clients can experience a straightforward and streamlined application process — all thanks to TeleLife.
